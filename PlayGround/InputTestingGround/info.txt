This folder is used to test some key actions, since working in the inputPlayback i found out that some key inputs work differently 
from others and thus i required a way of testing my keyboard layout to check what kind of handling is needed for each case

For example pynput doesn't treat the numpad 'numbers' as numbers, instead it throws their 'key codes', which means i need an 
adaptor for when the playback happens
